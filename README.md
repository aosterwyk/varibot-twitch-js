VariBot is a twitch chat bot with some custom features that were missing from existing bots. Some features include:
- Updating google spreadsheet of games completed on stream with current game's name and timestamp.
- Choose random game from google spreadsheet.
- Playing sounds for channel points (pubsub) rewards. 
- Choosing a random GTA radio station.
- Listing the GTA timelines based on the game currently being played.
- Automatic !multi command when "!multi" and "@\<username\>" are in stream title.

This project was started to learn node. ~~It may eventually be public.~~ Now it is!
